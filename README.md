# 🧠 Machine Learning Repository

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Repository** — a centralized collection of projects, experiments, and practice notebooks created to explore and master various ML algorithms, techniques, and datasets. This repo includes hands-on implementations ranging from basic supervised learning to advanced deep learning and model deployment.


## 🎯 Goals

- ✅ Understand core machine learning concepts through implementation  
- ✅ Practice on various real-world and synthetic datasets  
- ✅ Experiment with classic ML, deep learning, and deployment  
- ✅ Document findings, observations, and results

- **Classification** (e.g., digit recognition, spam detection)
- **Clustering** (e.g., customer segmentation)
- **Deep Learning** (CNNs for image tasks, RNNs for sequences)

### 🔸 `notebooks/`
Standalone notebooks for:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Algorithm comparisons
- Model evaluation techniques
- Concept demos (e.g., bias-variance, learning rate effects)

### 🔸 `datasets/`
Contains dataset references or small datasets used for practice and demonstration.
