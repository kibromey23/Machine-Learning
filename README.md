![ML Banner](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*zVnWJtyGOX_kUIDm6ccCfQ.png)

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Repository** — a centralized collection of mini-projects, experiments, and hands-on notebooks created to explore and master a wide range of machine learning algorithms and techniques.

> 🚀 From basic linear regression to deep learning and model deployment, this repo is designed for continuous learning and experimentation!

---

## 🎯 Goals

✔️ Understand core ML concepts through practical implementation  
✔️ Apply ML on both synthetic and real-world datasets  
✔️ Explore traditional ML, deep learning, and deployment  
✔️ Build reusable code and document learnings
